# Unity Solitaire

Game is completely functional and replayable 

## Things that could be fixed / improved if so desired later on 

1. Add an Undo button between discard and goals to allow for undoing actions
2. During final code cleanup/review, missed some hardcoded offset floats that could be changed to referencing variables
3. Some clipping with z-position at times(i.e make z position closer to camera for held cards)
4. Occasionally the trigger for autocompleting the game for some reason leaves two cards outside of the goal area just randomly floating
